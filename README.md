# Inusrance Prediction Model
In in this project we tried to create different machine learning supervised models for pedicting whether a given house should consider apply for insurance. The data preprocessing and visualization will be included in this project.

The machine learning techniques/models used are: **Decision Tree Classifier**, **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, **SVM Classifier**, and **MLP Classifier**. 

## The Code
- The `main.ipynb` is the main entry point for the project.
- Other files contain useful code for formatting, normalizing, and preprocessing of the data.
